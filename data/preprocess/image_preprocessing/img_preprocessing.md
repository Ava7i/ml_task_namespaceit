# Image Preprocessing and Augmentation

## Overview
This repository contains code for image preprocessing and augmentation, designed to enhance image quality, diversity, and prepare data for this tasks.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

# Preprocessing Techniques
- Resizing: Adjust image dimensions for consistency or model requirements.
- Normalization: Scale pixel values to a standard range for better convergence during training.
- Grayscale Conversion: Convert images to grayscale for certain algorithms or reduced complexity.
- Histogram Equalization: Enhance contrast by redistributing pixel intensities.
- Noise Removal: Apply filters (e.g., Gaussian, Median) to reduce noise.

# Augmentation Methods
- Rotation: Randomly rotate images within a specified range to introduce variance.
- Flip: Horizontal and vertical flips for data diversification.
- Translation: Shift images horizontally or vertically to simulate different perspectives.
- Zoom: Randomly zoom into sections of the image to focus on details.
- Brightness and Contrast Adjustment: Alter brightness and contrast for robustness to different lighting conditions.
- Color Jittering: Introduce random color variations for better generalization.
# Usage
Preprocessing
```
preprocess.py contains functions for preprocessing images.
Execute python preprocess.py --input_path <input_directory> --output_path <output_directory> --options <preprocessing_options>.
# Options might include resizing, normalization, etc., specified as flags or arguments.
```
# Augmentation
```
augment.py provides functions for image augmentation.
Run python augment.py --input_path <input_directory> --output_path <output_directory> --options <augmentation_options>.
Options could involve rotation, flipping, etc., specified similarly to preprocessing.
```
# Examples
bash
Copy code
# Preprocessing
```
python preprocess.py --input_path data/raw_images --output_path data/processed_images --resize 100 100 --normalize --grayscale
```
# Augmentation
```
python augment.py --input_path data/processed_images --output_path data/augmented_images --rotate 30 --flip --zoom 0.2 --brightness 0.5
```
# Notes
Always maintain a backup of original images before preprocessing or augmentation.
Experiment with different parameters to find the best settings for the dataset and task.
Ensure proper data splitting for training, validation, and testing after preprocessing and augmentation.
